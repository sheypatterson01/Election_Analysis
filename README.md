## Election-Audit Summary:
This script does very well for this specific audit, but if you wanted to inclue different data or additional data it could be easily modified. Right now the filters for this script are curently county and candidates, but if you wanted to include more demographics it would be a simple addition. Additonally, you could modify it to see what candidate recived a specific perentage by county. This would show you who was most popular based of a specific region of the state. There are seberal ways this code could be modified and improved, but it is a sturdy script with plenty of playroom.
